I even alerted food panda agent to remind the restaurant but nothing was done by the agent and the food came all in one container, every item all dumped inside, fried food, soggy vegetables etc looking like something like dog food. I complained to food panda and they didn't give me a refund but gave me a five dollars voucher instead and told me that sometimes the restaurant won't have the items requested.

The food was delivered on time but we were disappointed with the HUGE difference between the ordered food and the displayed food on the menu. The salmon on the menu was in decent size and the amount of rice looked sufficient. This was the complete opposite of what we received. The salmon was in tiny bits and the rice didn‚Äôt even reach half of the container. If the salmon bits were combined, it would NOT make up 1/4 of what they advertised. We were completely in shock! This restaurant didn‚Äôt execute what they were marketing. False marketing indeed!",

But yesterday's (Dec 29) order - the food was rather dissapointing. The taste isn't as good as before. Ex. Seafood Horfun used to have a reasonable quantity of fresh fish slices, prawns & squids. But now, it is chicken slices, fish-cake slices, and shrimps. At the same price. And why does a seafood dish contains chicken meat ?? \nI do understand the increase cost for groceries. If so, then revised the price of your food while keeping the seafood ingredients reasonably in the dish. And not just replacing it with a cheaper ingredient, ie. sliced chicken breast meat.",

Many thanks to their staff who have always provided excellent service not only in preparing and packing the food neatly, but also for making the effort to call us for alternative replacements should an item that we have ordered be not available.\nLast but not least, many thanks also to the very friendly, polite and efficient FoodPanda delivery guy who delivered our food in perfect condition and within the stipulated time-frame.",

Their food menu shows lamb , fish and chicken items so we never doubted this place. When i contacted the food panda agent first they told me it is because the dish had a lot of vegetables so i didnt feel it is chicken. Trust me thats what they told me. They taught me a few things about indian food which i myself being an Indian never knew. On following up again the agent said the restaurant shamiana is a veg reataurant and they offer only mock chicken. I wonder how paneer kadai could be mock chicken. My friend also had a veey bad tasting experience from this place last week. I would certainly not recommend this place and would appreciate if the menu for the restaurant reflects the reality and the agents are a bit more trained around the dishes",

They not only gave me food I didn't want but I requested under notes to put the rice and big drumstick separately. I even alerted food panda agent to remind the restaurant but nothing was done by the agent and the food came all in one container, every item all dumped inside, fried food, soggy vegetables etc looking like something like dog food. I complained to food panda and they didn't give me a refund but gave me a five dollars voucher instead and told me that sometimes the restaurant won't have the items requested. How can a stall run out of white rice? That's ridiculous. So disappointed.",

I‚Äôve been placing orders from their western food and some other dishes or meals.\n\nBut their salted egg chicken rice, at $7.50\nPer set (excluding delivery), really didn‚Äôt meet my basic expectations at all.\n\nJust sharing.

With poor attitude, claimed that she did not receive our pick-up order. Saw the receipt of order came out and did not proceed to prepare the food for 12:00PM pick-up timing as she claimed that our order did not appear on FoodPanda system and scared that we may cancel their order. When she showed the tablet of FoodPanda page claiming that there was no order appearing in the system, we pointed out to her the order name \"Wenglum\" was there. From there, she claimed that \"Oh now then appear\". We also overhead the manager argument with the worker to and the manager even made a comment saying \"we should cancel this order since it's such a big order\" as she appeared to keep rushing her worker for the slowness in preparing the large order. Really disappointed with such bad attitude from the duty manager. We waited about 40-45mins from the originally order of 12:00PM. Very bad service from Yassin Kampung.",

I even said that I could go and find him, although with a sprained knee. \n\nHe yelled ‚Äú  You never write Block! Waste my time never mind!‚Äù\nAnd hung up on me abruptly. I hobbled outside and called his number to hear a phone ringing nearby. He deliberately did not pick up and let it ring ON PURPOSE until I shouted ‚Äúhello‚Äù.\n\nHe rudely exclaimed that I did not put in the block address in front of the block B signage where we were standing. He opened his phone and showed me ‚Äú You never write block!‚Äù\n\nI said, ‚Äú This is Block B as I have written. ‚Äú \nI pointed to his phone, to the address I wrote as ‚ÄúBlock B‚Äù and the signage saying that we were standing at Block B.\n\nHe did not once apologised and coyly smiled and said he had no phone line and he was annoyed that the security needed his IC to enter the building carpark. \n\nI was so angry. This is my second foodpanda experience and I demand some kind of explanation for this kind of rude behaviour. Is it my fault that the security wants his ID and that his ‚Äúphone has no line to see the block‚Äù? \n\nI feel pity for him as he‚Äôs an old man trying to make a living. But in the service line, you need to have more professional riders. I will not pay for rudeness.",

Here is my full review - I have since stayed away from Foodpanda because of its interests in protecting their partners over being honest to enhance the experience of their customers by filtering out reviews with poor ratings. \n\nUnder no circumstances order the \"Norwegian shrimp\" on \"brioche\", which is a euphemism for four frozen shrimp with itty bits of capsicum on a slice of bread for $10. Same goes for the 'mash garlic potato' side with the steak(s), which is a small dry scoop of suspiciously potato-flakey reconstituted mash. Don't bother with the chimichurri sauce, it's over-oiled and the herbs taste stale. \n\nThe fries side is acceptable (in relation) and the steak was done to request but frankly mediocre and not worth the money. For $20, you can get a really lovely cut of steak and panfry it with more flavour than Cafe Etc could ever give you. \n\nDelivery time was the only upside, but I suspect it's because Cafe Etc wasn't in charge of that.",

Here is my full review - I have since stayed away from Foodpanda because of its interests in protecting their partners over being honest to enhance the experience of their customers by filtering out reviews with poor ratings. \n\nUnder no circumstances order the \"Norwegian shrimp\" on \"brioche\", which is a euphemism for four frozen shrimp with itty bits of capsicum on a slice of bread for $10. Same goes for the 'mash garlic potato' side with the steak(s), which is a small dry scoop of suspiciously potato-flakey reconstituted mash. Don't bother with the chimichurri sauce, it's over-oiled and the herbs taste stale. \n\nThe fries side is acceptable (in relation) and the steak was done to request but frankly mediocre and not worth the money. For $20, you can get a really lovely cut of steak and panfry it with more flavour than Cafe Etc could ever give you. \n\nDelivery time was the only upside, but I suspect it's because Cafe Etc wasn't in charge of that.",

Butter chicken- ah yes the slightly sweet, mildly spiced soft chicken, cooked and served in a generous amount of tangy tomato sauce. What we got? Fried rice with chicken cooked in butter. As in, plain white chicken in plain white butter. What Singaporean would ever expect that? From a place that also serves murtabak, Prata and other Indian dishes no less.\n\nThat aside, if we were to put aside our disappointment and review the dish for what it (sadly) was, it was still not fantastic. While the fried rice portion was fairly tasty at first, there was too much loose butter which made the rice below quite mushy! The chicken was... fine. But definitely NOT worth $9.10. Neither one of us finished our food despite being very hungry.",

I like to add mincemeat to my fishball Mee. I don't see an option. I also heard that their fried wanton is good but I couldn't see an option for it. I asked for extra soya sauce Chili packets but they only gave me one. So was a bit disappointed with that. Other than that very happy with the food and service from food panda :\")",

        "description": "Hi, foodpanda. Since this is an email dedicated to reporting an issue with a rider, I'll give a detailed explanation of what happened, so as to prevent misunderstandings on both our parts. Firstly, the food came half an hour late. I have no issues on that, since the restaurant could have been having more customers at that time. Completely not your fault. Then, another issue popped up. The rider. I expected my food to arrive when the rider had said that he had arrived, but well, clearly I was wrong. The rider claimed to be at my floor, at my block, in my condominium. He wasn't. He insisted he was at block 52 (the block I stay at), and when i told him I could not see anyone outside my door, he insisted he was at my place. He went down to my basement, up to the 28th floor again, insisting over and over again he was at my block. I then asked for a picture of his surroundings, so I could confirm that he was indeed at my place. He did not reply. Ok, so what do I do now? I called him. I asked him where he was, trying to find out where he could be, since he definitely wasn't at my place. He went mumbling abit, going all \"uhh\" and such. He then suddenly asked me where I stayed. Really? I was quite sure I had keyed in my address when I ordered my food. Fine. I told him the name of the condominium I stay at, before he suddenly realised he was at the WRONG condominium. Not the wrong block, nor the wrong floor. But the WRONG condominium? How clueless does one have to be to mess that up? Sure, everyone makes mistakes. But his insistent attitude, and nonchalant behaviour as if he did not care that he could have made a mistake is why I am writing this email. If he spoke with more sincerity, maybe even slightly apologetically, I wouldn't be writing this email. I'm not sure how you guys hire riders, but I sure would like you guys to reconsider how you hire your riders. \nNow, I'm sitting on my chair, furiously typing out this email. In front of me is my meal that I paid 13 dollars for: a crushed up box of my meal, soggy fries, and the fact that this whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Guess that counts as a free of charge dish. Thanks.",

I understand that the restaurant might be busy but then what‚Äôs the point of ordering in advance then?\n\nAt first the rider told me that the order will be running late around 6+pm (my pre-order was 7:15pm). I was expecting the food to arrive latest by 7:45pm but my food didn‚Äôt arrive and the rider didn‚Äôt reply my message so I approached the help center wanting to cancel the order around 8:40+pm. The reply was ‚Äúwe will make sure that it is delivered to you by 8:57pm.‚Äù (I received a voucher for apologies) so I decided to wait a little longer. \n\nThen after that I received a reply from the rider saying he already went back (?) I don‚Äôt really get it but I wish he messaged me earlier if the food is delaying for more than one and a half hour.\n\nBy the way I received my food at 9:24pm.\nNormally I love foodpanda deliveries but had a horrible experience this time.",

Even if you wanted to skimp on the ingredients, you could have at least given more soup.\nThe coconut milk in the red ruby dessert tasted off as well (was not fresh) and the components were clearly frozen as the texture was brittle. \nThe only redeeming quality here is that they make khao soi, which is very hard to find in Singapore.

With poor attitude, claimed that she did not receive our pick-up order. Saw the receipt of order came out and did not proceed to prepare the food for 12:00PM pick-up timing as she claimed that our order did not appear on FoodPanda system and scared that we may cancel their order. When she showed the tablet of FoodPanda page claiming that there was no order appearing in the system, we pointed out to her the order name \"Wenglum\" was there. From there, she claimed that \"Oh now then appear\". We also overhead the manager argument with the worker to and the manager even made a comment saying \"we should cancel this order since it's such a big order\" as she appeared to keep rushing her worker for the slowness in preparing the large order. Really disappointed with such bad attitude from the duty manager. We waited about 40-45mins from the originally order of 12:00PM. Very bad service from Yassin Kampung.",

Their food menu shows lamb , fish and chicken items so we never doubted this place. When i contacted the food panda agent first they told me it is because the dish had a lot of vegetables so i didnt feel it is chicken. Trust me thats what they told me. They taught me a few things about indian food which i myself being an Indian never knew. On following up again the agent said the restaurant shamiana is a veg reataurant and they offer only mock chicken. I wonder how paneer kadai could be mock chicken. My friend also had a veey bad tasting experience from this place last week. I would certainly not recommend this place and would appreciate if the menu for the restaurant reflects the reality and the agents are a bit more trained around the dishes",

Its too strong. \n\nI would appreciate it, if they could give me choice on my favourite chicken parts. Previously I was able to request for drumstick and acar. \nBut now no more and this dissapoint me as i dont eat chicken breast\n\nBriyani is not complete without acar.

I do understand those mistakes can happen but I would appreciate if the rider pay close attention to the address. The neighbors upstairs might mistakenly took in my food if they also ordered like I did (I just stating one of possibilities). Luckily I mentioned in my notes for riders \"not to knock and leave my food at the door gate\", so the food was left untouched. I didn't pay S$3.49 just to bear with those mistakes. I would have pick up the food myself which saves me alot of money. Please ensure this kind of mistakes won't happen in the future. Thanks.",
